# Featured Project: IGloobe - Motion Capture Interaction System

## Project Description
I led the development of IGloobe, an innovative motion capture interaction system developed in C#. This pioneering project enabled presentation control and interactive drawing using tracking technology similar to Nintendo's Wiimote, but with specific applications for educational and corporate environments.

## Technologies and Demonstrated Skills

### Advanced Mastery of C# and .NET Framework
* Implemented a modular and extensible architecture using the most advanced features of C#
* Developed abstract and concrete interfaces to ensure low coupling and high cohesion
* Used reflection capabilities to create dynamic and adaptable systems
* Implemented asynchronous communication to ensure a responsive interface

### Design Patterns and Software Architecture
* Applied multiple design patterns (Singleton, Factory, State, Observer, Template Method) in an integrated manner
* Designed a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
* Implemented a robust state management system for device connections
* Created an extensible system that allows easy addition of new features

### Hardware Integration and Low-Level Communication
* Developed Bluetooth communication using the InTheHand.Net.Personal library
* Implemented communication with HID (Human Interface Device) devices
* Used P/Invoke for direct interaction with native Windows APIs
* Created coordinate transformation algorithms to map 3D movements in 2D space

### Innovative Graphical Interface
* Developed transparent and draggable forms for better user experience
* Implemented real-time drawing system with color and thickness control
* Created minimalist and non-intrusive interfaces for use in presentations
* Developed intuitive visual calibration system

### Complex Problem Solving
* Implemented smoothing algorithms to reduce jitter in motion capture
* Developed four-point calibration system for precision in spatial mapping
* Created automatic reconnection mechanisms to ensure stability
* Implemented detection and prevention system for multiple instances
